## 📂 Project Structure & Organization
- Organize into folders: `controllers/`, `routes/`, `models/`, `services/`, `utils/`
- Keep files small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Store secrets in `.env` (with `dotenv`), never in code

## 🎨 Code Style & Quality
- Follow a style guide (e.g., Airbnb)
- Use ESLint + Prettier for consistency
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use `async/await` instead of callback hell

## ⚠️ Error Handling
- Centralize error handling (e.g., Express middleware)
- Never swallow errors silently
- Wrap async calls in `try/catch`

## 🔒 Security Practices
- Validate user input (`joi`, `zod`)
- Escape/encode output to prevent XSS
- Use `helmet` for secure HTTP headers
- Don’t commit `.env` or secrets
- Keep dependencies updated (`npm audit`, `snyk`)

## 🚀 Performance & Scalability
- Use clustering/worker threads
- Cache heavy operations (Redis, memory)
- Use streaming for large files
- Avoid blocking the event loop

## 🧪 Testing & Monitoring
- Write tests (unit + integration) with Jest/Mocha
- Use structured logging (`winston`, `pino`)
- Monitor apps (PM2, APM tools)

## 📦 Dependency Management
- Lock versions (`package-lock.json`)
- Minimize dependencies
- Use `nvm` for Node version consistency

## 🌐 API & Modularization
- Use Express/Koa/Fastify with clear routes
- Keep business logic separate from routes
- Return consistent JSON responses
